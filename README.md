1. No^Man is inspired by Today I Die. 
2. There are 3 areas with puzzles and a final area that ties off loose ends. 
3. If you get stuck on the second puzzle, remember that you can drag words AND items. Also, the second puzzle only needs one word to be changed. Disregard the second red word. You Can't Always Fix A Broken Heart. 
4. Don't jump into the the simple looking blue stuff or the simple looking red stuff. Those are water and lava respectively and both will kill you, Also Respectively. 
5. Sure, you can cheat. But, you have to live with knowing that you've left the world as bad off as it was when you got there. Remember, No Man Is An Island. 
6. Words can be dangerous. If you happen to hit your character with a word with enough force, it's entirely possible that he will clip through the earth and die. Keep This In Mind While You Are Playing. 

I didn't have time to write code that returned you to the beginning when you fall, so if you happen to fall off, hit escape and start over. (Apologies ahead of time, will be adding checkpoints soon!) 

Enjoy and thanks for playing!
